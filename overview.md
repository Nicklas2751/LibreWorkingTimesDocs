LibreWorkingTimes looks different based on how big your screen resolution is, what language you have set for your web browser and if your device preference is set to light- or darkmode.

## The menu

On big screens the menu is shown on the left. On smaller screens the menu is hidden and can be shown with the burger icon (red circled in the screenshot).
